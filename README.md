>   I am a part of **ADOPT** group at IIT Madras (Advanced Design Optimization and Probabilistic Techniques). This group focuses on _optimization and probabilistic and metamodeling techniques_ for the problems where small data is available. My research was focused on developing interpretable multidimensional visualization technique which can be helpful for designer to take informed decisions.
